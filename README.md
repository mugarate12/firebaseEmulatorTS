This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

And, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Tests

If you not have firebase CLI, run:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Sign in in your google account with firebase tools:

```bash
firebase login
```

Create initial config to firebase emulator.
Config this to use firestore and emulators (included emulator UI):

```bash
firebase init
```

Initialize Emulator UI:

```bash
firebase emulators:start
```

And, run jest tests with:

```bash
npm run test
```

Look documentation to firebase emulator:

- [Firebase Emulator Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/connect_and_prototype?authuser=0)

Observations:

- You see in firebase emulator UI, all changes on firestore comes to firestore provided here
